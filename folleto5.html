<h2>Ten Men with Leprosy</h2>

<h2>On his way to Jerusalem, J-sus went along the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men with leprosy came toward him. They stood at a distance and shouted, "J-sus, Master, have pity on us!" J-sus looked at them and said, "Go show yourselves to the priests."</h2>

<h2>On their way they were healed. When one of them discovered that he was healed, he came back, shouting praises to God. He bowed down at the feet of J-sus and thanked him. The man was from the country of Samaria. Jesus asked, "Weren't ten men healed? Where are the other nine? Why was this foreigner the only one who came back to thank God?" Then Jesus told the man, "You may get up and go. Your faith has made you well."</h2>

<h2></h2>7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus</h2>
